    "Description": "Identification of active molecules against Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an ensemble of data from ChEMBL25 (Target IDs 360, 2111188 and 2366634). The final model is a stacking model integrating four algorithms, including support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting and deep neural networks.",
